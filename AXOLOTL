<h1>Axolotl</h1>
<p>The axolotl or "Mexican salamander" (who looks like a Pok√©mon , if you ask me) 
is often spotted in lakes in various places around Mexico. These little salamanders are amphibious 
although often spend their adult lives strictly in the water. However, the population of these cute 
creatures is dwindling due to non-native predators and the continued urbanization of Mexico. The 
axolotl eats small worms, insects, and fish in order to survive..</p>
